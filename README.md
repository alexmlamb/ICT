This repo consists Pytorch code for the paper Intepolation Consistency Training for Semi-supervised Learning (Insert arxiv link here)

In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient algorith for training Deep Neural Networks in the Semi-supervised setting, using interpolations between the unlabeled data samples. Our method outperforms (or is competitive with) other recent state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets, despite having no significant additional computation cost.
